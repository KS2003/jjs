# Authorization and Access Control
## Sudo mode
Sudo mode for some scope (global or contest) disables any further right checking for objects and resources
 in this scope, including:
 - submitting and managing submissions
 - managing contest state (start, stop, remove)
 - grant additional rights (except SUDO bit) to other users
