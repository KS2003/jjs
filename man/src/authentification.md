# Authentification
## Root user authentification
JJS has builtin root user, with username "$root" (Note that $ prefix can't be used in non-special user accounts).
### Development root user
When JJS is running in development mode, you can authenticate as root, using "dev_root" string as access token
This option is automatically disabled in non-development environment, and shouldn't be turned on forcefully.
