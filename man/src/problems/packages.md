# Package types
There are two package types in JJS: _source package_, and _compiled package_.
## Compiled packages
Compiled packages are read directly by JJS invoker. They are not intended for human-reading. 
Compiled package for problem with id FOO is placed in $ROOT/var/problems/FOO.
## Source packages
These packages are optional (you can compile problems with your own tooling).
See more about them in [TT](tt.md) page.
